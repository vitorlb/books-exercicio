# books-exercicio
static book challenge website

javascript final exercise I made in my frontend development course in EDIT Disruptive Education, at Porto.

Its a basic exercise that consists in listing a list of books, and its authors. One of the challanges was to paginate the list, other one was to make a simple search by term feature.

CSS got pretty dope. Retro style.
